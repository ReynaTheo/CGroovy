                            <p>Since 2006, we have started our journey in the world of music technology with a vision to create a more personal and enjoyable music listening experience. That year, we launched our first simple music platform, which allowed users to manage and listen to their music collection more easily. This laid the foundation for our innovative spirit in delivering technology solutions that make the lives of music fans easier.</p>

                            <p>Entering 2015, we took a big step by developing a more sophisticated music application, equipped with streaming features and music recommendations based on user preferences. This development marks a new era for us, where we not only focus on storing music, but also on how music can be enjoyed more dynamically and interactively.</p>

                            <p>In 2018, we introduced the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our app, allowing users to get more accurate and personalized music recommendations. This feature was a major breakthrough that solidified our position as one of the pioneers in the music app industry. We also expanded our reach by launching the app on multiple platforms, including mobile and desktop, to ensure wider accessibility.</p>

                            <p>2019 was the year we further strengthened our commitment to quality and user experience. We launched the playlist collaboration feature, which allows users to share and create playlists with their friends. In addition, we also introduced the offline mode feature, allowing users to enjoy their favorite music without an internet connection. These innovations bring us closer to our mission: to bring music to everyone, anytime, anywhere.</p>
